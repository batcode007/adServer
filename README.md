# adServer

This repo contains an adServer folder and an adScript file.
This is used to append an image dynamically to an existing div element on the page.

To run :
1. Open the adScript.js file and replace the divId with the one where you want the image to be inserted.
2. Paste and run the script present in the adScript.js file on any web-browser.
3. An image would be appended in the div id passed. 

The api urls are hosted on aws api gateway and the image is stored on aws s3.
